  _name: Lord Commander Orangu Tain the 3rd
  _backstory: An active general that comes from an aristocratic family. He gained
    36 medals in a battle of the peach bay. However he is rumoured to incarcerate
    lemon combatants without a trial.
  _crimes: 'Tax fraud. He didn''t pay taxes for his maid and pocketed the difference.
    However we couldn''t find the maid in question, so we have no witness. '
  _excuses: '"I am a very busy fruit. There was never any maid and I pay all my taxes.
    You were fooled by my political rivals. Do you know I will run for a chancellor
    in the next election? I am also known for my generosity towards my friends."'
